# About the Project
The main goal of this project was to identify cheaters in PlayerUnknownâ€™s Battlegrounds (PUBG), one of the most popular games in the world, using anomaly detection. The analysis was based on the assumption that cheaters are players who have absurdly above-average performance in games.

# Methodology 
* Data: 4 million players' match summaries collected through *PUBG Developer API* with 29 features
* Identified top features that were correlated with winning the game using LightGBM
* Detected outliers via data profiling
  * Visualized top features using Plotly
  * Looked at extreme values via calculating quantiles of each features
* Treated the outliers found by data profiling as the ground truth
* Used One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest to automatically detect outliers
* Tuned and evaluated models through computing the true positive rates (what proportion of outliers found by data profiling are also identified as anomaly by models)
  * SVM: 98.87%
  * Isolation Forest: 91.27%
* Integrated the results of two models
  * Computed overlap coefficient of the outliers by One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest: 64.39%
  * Regarded the overlapping population to be highly likely to be cheaters
